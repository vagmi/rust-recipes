# Rust learning language recipes

This has some common language goals that I use on a day to day basis.

* [x] Read and write to files
* [x] JSON serialization / deserialization
* [ ] Binary serialization / deserialization
* [ ] Connect to postgresql database and perform basic crud operations
* [ ] Create a HTTP microservice for basic routing and middleware
* [ ] Create a CLI with ability to access comand line params
* [ ] Launch processes and read from their STDOUT/STDERR and write to STDIN
* [ ] Basic crypto primitives (generate keypair, encrypt, decrypt)
